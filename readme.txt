Done: class library , Db files in app_data. event data modification only for admins, main page, 

Not done: not able to group the events for a single day togther. 

challenges: moving Identitymodel.cs to the data library - after scouring the internet i found out that the packages that were missing could be insalled using nuget. 
plus some trouble with the date format and how best to display it i.e is implementing a [DisplayFormat] better in the class defination ? or manipulate the data at the view level
